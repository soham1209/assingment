What are the Conditional Operators in Java?

Conditional operators in Java include:
&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
?: (Ternary Operator)
! (Logical NOT)


What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?

Unary Operators: Operate on one operand (e.g., ++, --, !).
Binary Operators: Operate on two operands (e.g., +, -, *, /, &&, ||).
Ternary Operators: Operate on three operands (e.g., ?:).


What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?

The switch case is used to execute one block of code from multiple conditions. It is an alternative to using multiple if-else statements, providing a more readable and efficient way to handle multiple conditions.


What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?

Priority levels (from highest to lowest):
()
*, /, %
+, -


What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in Java?

Conditional statements include if, if-else, else-if, switch.
They are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. This allows the flow of the program to change based on the result of evaluated expressions.


What is the syntax of if-else statement?


if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}


What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?

for loop
while loop
do-while loop


Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop.

for loop:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
Executes the loop body zero or more times.
do-while loop:

do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.


public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
