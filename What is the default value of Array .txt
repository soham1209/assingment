What is the default value of Array for different data types

byte, short, int, long: 0
float, double: 0.0
char: '\u0000' (null character)
boolean: false
Object references (e.g., Strings, Arrays): null


Can you pass the negative number in Array size

No, you cannot pass a negative number as the size of an array. Doing so will result in a NegativeArraySizeException.


Where does Array stored in JVM memory

Arrays are stored in the heap memory in JVM.


What are the disadvantages of Array

Fixed size: Once created, the size of the array cannot be changed.
Homogeneous data structure: Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.
Lack of built-in methods: Unlike other data structures like lists, arrays lack built-in methods for common operations like insertion and deletion.


What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an example

An anonymous array is an array without a name and is used for instant use. It is generally used to pass an array as an argument to a method.
Example:

public class Test {
    static void printArray(int arr[]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        printArray(new int[]{10, 22, 44, 66});
    }
}


What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java

Using for loop:

for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
}


Using enhanced for loop (for-each loop):

for (int element : array) {
    System.out.print(element + " ");
}

Using while loop:

int i = 0;
while (i < array.length) {
    System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
    i++;
}

Using Arrays.stream() (Java 8 and above):

Arrays.stream(array).forEach(element -> System.out.print(element + " "));


What is the difference between length and length() method? Give examples

length: It is an attribute of an array that gives the size (number of elements) of the array.
Example:

int[] arr = new int[5];
System.out.println(arr.length); // Output: 5
length(): It is a method of the String class that returns the number of characters in the string.
Example:

String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length()); // Output: 5
