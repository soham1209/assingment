1. What is a String in Java?

A String in Java is a sequence of characters. It's an object that represents text data.

2. Types of String in Java are?

There is only one type of String in Java: the String class. This class provides methods for manipulating and operating on strings.

3. In how many ways can you create string objects in Java?

There are primarily two ways to create String objects in Java:
Using string literals (e.g., String str = "Hello";)
Using the new keyword with the String constructor (e.g., String str = new String("Hello");)

4. What is a string constant pool?

The string constant pool is a special area in the Java memory where String literals are stored. When you create a string literal, the JVM checks if the string already exists in the pool. If it does, it returns a reference to the existing string. If not, it creates a new string in the pool and returns a reference to it. This optimization helps save memory and improves performance.

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?

Mutable objects can be changed after they are created. Their state can be modified.
Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created. Their state remains constant throughout their lifetime. Strings in Java are immutable.

6. Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?

The string constant pool is located in the heap memory. It's a specific section of the heap where String literals are stored.
