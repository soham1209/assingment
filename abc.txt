The Collection framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that help in storing and manipulating groups of objects. It includes classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap, and interfaces like List, Set, and Map.

What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList is based on a dynamic array, so accessing elements is faster (O(1)), but inserting and deleting elements is slower (O(n)).
LinkedList is based on a doubly linked list, so insertion and deletion are faster (O(1)), but access time is slower (O(n)).

What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Iterator can traverse elements in one direction (forward) and can remove elements.
ListIterator can traverse in both directions (forward and backward), modify elements, and add new ones.

What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Iterator is part of the Collection framework and allows removing elements while traversing.
Enumeration is an older interface, doesn't support element removal, and is less powerful.

What is the difference between List and Set?
List allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
Set does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee any specific order.

What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
HashSet stores elements using a hash table, provides constant-time operations, and doesn't guarantee order.
TreeSet stores elements in a sorted tree (Red-Black tree), guaranteeing sorted order but slower performance.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Array has a fixed size, while ArrayList is dynamic and can resize itself.
ArrayList provides more flexible operations like adding, removing, and manipulating elements, while arrays are more performant when size is constant.

What is a Map in Java? 
A Map is an interface in Java that represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Common examples include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

What are the commonly used implementations of Map in Java? 
Common implementations include:
HashMap: No order, constant-time performance.
TreeMap: Sorted order based on keys.
LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.

What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
HashMap provides O(1) time complexity for basic operations and doesn't guarantee any order.
TreeMap provides O(log n) time complexity and guarantees that keys will be sorted.

How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
You can use the containsKey(Object key) method to check if a key exists in a map. Example: map.containsKey(key) returns true if the key exists, otherwise false.
